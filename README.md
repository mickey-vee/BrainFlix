# BrainFlix

**BrainFlix** is a full-stack video viewing app built using **React** on the front-end and **Express.js** on the back-end. Originally developed as part of the BrainStation Software Engineering bootcamp, it mimics a YouTube-like experience with features such as video selection, commenting, and video uploading. 

Instead of videos, images are used, as the primary focus of the project was managing state and connecting the front-end to the back-end with read routes.

## Features

- **Video Selection**: Browse and select from a list of videos.
- **Comments**: View and add comments to each video.
- **Video Upload**: Upload new videos (represented by images) to the platform.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface that adapts to all screen sizes.

## Project Evolution

- Initially built using **Express**, **Node**, and **JSON** for data storage.
- Later enhanced with a database using **MySQL**, **Knex**, **Express**, and **Node.js** for more robust data management.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End:
- **HTML**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **SASS**

### Back-End:
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MySQL**
- **Knex.js**

## How to Run

### Front-End
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the React app with `npm start`.

### Back-End
1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Set up your MySQL database and update the `.env` file with your credentials.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

**BrainFlix** was one of the first React apps developed during the bootcamp, providing an opportunity to manage state, implement CRUD operations, and build a fully responsive full-stack application.
